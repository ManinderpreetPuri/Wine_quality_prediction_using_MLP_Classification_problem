# Wine_quality_prediction_using_MLP_Classification_problem
In this project we will convert the problem we solved using regression notebook into a classification problem instead. So we will assign each wine quality rating to a different class. So quality of 0 will belong to a different class to quality of 1.  The biggest difference between a regression solution and multi-class classification in terms of implementation is that now our model needs to output 10 values (1 for each quality rating) instead of just a single output. Also we will need to change our loss function.
